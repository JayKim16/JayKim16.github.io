    <p>About the <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/siberian-husky/">Siberian Husky</a>:</p>
    <p>The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute.</p>
    <p>As born pack dogs, they enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe’s innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must.</p>
    <p>Attractive features of the breed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Naturally clean</li>
      <li>Little doggy odor</li>
    </ul>
